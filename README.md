# IndoorNavigationSystem
Undergrad major project for Symbiosis Institute of Technology. 
Project duration: February 2014 - May 2014

This project is a primary approach to creating an Indoor Navigation System prototype for buildings. GPS cannot be used inside buildings for positioning and navigation purposes. This problem was solved by our implementation of a system with the help of sensor fusion of the available Android inertial sensors with Wi-Fi signal strength(RSSI) measurements.
